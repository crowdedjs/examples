To Do:
- Finish porting code
- Test that extending MedicalAgent and PatientAgent granted them other behaviors
- Test behavior trees
- Able to pass in values to all the behaviors, like GoTo?

Ryan's notes on features that need to be expanded or added:
- Emergencies are simply failure placeholders currently
- AssignBed needs a list of beds(rooms) to grab from
- Tech and Resident have same tree but different starting place
