To Do:
- Finish trees
- Forget which update format was right in the trees, I think it was the shorter one. Fix them!
- How to implement addComment in HospitalModel from Java code and Log
- Question in Computer related files on how to reference computer
- ComputerAssignPatientRoom needs list of rooms
- Need help with TakeTime.js
- Might be missing some imports
- delete Type and subClass (and location?) from patient and medical agent stuff (already represented
with name and type)
- There are multiple rooms of each type

Testing:
- Throwing errors doesn't work
- Test that extending MedicalAgent and PatientAgent granted them other behaviors
- Test behavior trees
- Able to pass in values to all the behaviors, like GoTo?

Ryan's notes on features that need to be expanded or added:
- Emergencies are simply failure placeholders currently
- Janitorial just goes to Fast Track and waits forever (placeholder?)
- AssignBed needs a list of beds(rooms) to grab from
- Tech and Resident have same tree but different starting place
- Noticed ComputerEnterPatient.js is always "Unknown" complaint
- Noticed ComputerScorePatient.js is always "3" Es
