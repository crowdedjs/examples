Ryan's notes on features that need to be expanded or added:
- Emergencies are simply failure placeholders currently
- AssignBed needs a list of beds(rooms) to grab from
- Tech and Resident have same tree but different starting place
- Noticed ComputerEnterPatient.js is always "Unknown" complaint
- Noticed ComputerScorePatient.js is always "3" Es
